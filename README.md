# Fast-cars

This is my third app I build during my training at Udacity.com.
The main purpose was to get more feeling with buttons (Button, RadioButton, CheckBox) and the actions you can do with them.
Also get more feeling with the Layout and colors.

It contains a quiz with 5 questions about fast cars and you'll get a 'Toast' (popup) of the score if you SUBMIT your answers.

Have fun.
